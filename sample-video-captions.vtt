Japan is an island country in East Asia and is roughly

00:03.500 --> 00:06.600
9000 kilometres from North America.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.800
Like many countries from around the world,

00:08.800 --> 00:12.300
the drum has a very long history in Japanese Society.

00:12.300 --> 00:19.500
In fact, it is believed the Japanese drum, or Wadaiko, or simply Taiko

00:19.500 --> 00:24.000
has existed and was used in Japan over 2000 years ago.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.900
Throughout Japan's history, the Taiko has played an important role

00:27.900 --> 00:30.900
in the life and culture of the Japanese people.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.800
During some of Japan's great wars almost 500 years ago

00:34.800 --> 00:38.400
the Taiko would be beaten to energize the troops for battle,

00:38.400 --> 00:42.900
to set the marching pace, and to encourage troops as they approached victory.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.000
The Taiko's thunderous sound would also invoke fear into the enemies

00:47.000 --> 00:49.500
on the other side of the battlefield.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.700
The Taiko have always been used in religious ceremonies.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.100
It is very common to find Taiko in holy places such as shrines and temples

00:57.100 --> 00:59.100
where people go to pray.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.600
From ancient times, Taiko were used to pray for a bountiful harvest

01:02.600 --> 01:06.200
and to scare away evil spirits and pests that were harmful to the crops.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.400
It was believed that by imitating the sound of thunder on the Taiko

01:10.400 --> 01:13.700
the spirit of rain would be called into action.

01:13.700 --> 01:19.300
At local festivals called Matsuri the Taiko were played in thanks for a bountiful crop

01:19.300 --> 01:22.600
and villagers would enjoy dancing to the beat of the Taiko.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.800
It has been said that ancient boundaries were determined

01:25.800 --> 01:29.400
by the farthest distance one could hear the sound of the village Taiko.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.600
It was believed that the Taiko were also used to send messages

01:32.600 --> 01:36.700
to the villagers, such as signalling an approaching storm.

01:36.700 --> 01:41.800
Even to this day, the Taiko can be seen and heard at traditional theatre performances

01:41.800 --> 01:47.000
like Kabuki or Noh as well as at sumo wrestling tournaments.

01:49.900 --> 01:54.300
So, are you ready to test your knowledge on what you just watched?

01:54.300 --> 01:55.500
Here are three questions.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.100
Let's begin!

01:57.100 --> 01:59.200
What do you call a Japanese drum?

01:59.200 --> 02:08.400
A. Kabuki, B. Taiko, C. Temple, or D. Matsuri?

02:08.400 --> 02:12.400
If you chose "B. Taiko" you are correct!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.300
Next.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.400
How long has the Taiko existed in Japan for?

02:16.400 --> 02:28.100
A. 200 years, B. 500 years, C. 1500 years, or D. 2000 years?

02:28.100 --> 02:33.200
If you chose "D. 2000 years" you are correct!

02:33.200 --> 02:37.500
Finally, which purpose was the Taiko not used for?

02:37.500 --> 02:43.000
A. Encouraging troops on the battlefield, B Festivals, 

02:43.000 --> 02:51.500
C. To signal to the villagers that it was dinnertime, or D. Praying for rain and a rich harvest?

02:51.500 --> 02:56.600
If you chose "C. To signal to the villagers that it was dinnertime" you are correct!

02:56.600 --> 02:59.900
The Taiko were used in ancient villages to communicate things

02:59.900 --> 03:04.100
like an approaching storm, but not to signal that it was dinnertime.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.870
